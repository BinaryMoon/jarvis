== Page Templates ==

Jarvis comes bundled with a number of page templates. These can be used as follows:

* __Content Only__ - A template that removes the site header and footer and displays just the page content. This is a nice way to create totally custom layouts using the new editor. Ideal for landing pages, or store pages where the focus should be the page content.
* __Contributors__ - A list of all the people (users) who have contributed content (published at least one post) to your website, their most recent posts, and a link to their user archive.
* __Child Page Grid__ - Lists all of the pages that are children of the current page. Handy if you have a complex site hierachy.
* __Portfolio__ - Displays your most recent portfolio posts. Requires the Jetpack plugin. Allows you to add portfolio posts to your website homepage.
* __Full-Width__ - Stretch the content across the entire available space. This is best for pages using a page builder or more advanced Gutenberg blocks.

== Footer Credits ==

Jarvis allows you to edit or hide the footer credits. If you want to add your own then Jarvis includes some handy shortcuts to make it easier to manage.

* *(c)* - add a copyright symbol __@copy;__
* *(year)* - add the current year. This will update when the year changes, so no more forgetting to change things in the new year!
* *(|)* - add a gap between bits of footer content.
* *(privacy)* - add a link to your privacy policy as setup in the privacy section of your WordPress admin.
* *(top)* - add a link that scrolls the user to the top of the page.

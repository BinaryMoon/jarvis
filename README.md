# Jarvis
## A WordPress theme for Gutenberg

Jarvis is a highly optimised theme, designed with sustainable principles in mind, using modern web development techniques.

## Philosophy

I want Jarvis to be a lightweight theme. To do this I have:

* Removed images
* Used system fonts
* Minimised complex features like widgets, and nav
* Removed jQuery, and kept Javascript to an absolute minimum

# Development

If you wish to work on Jarvis you will need to have node and npm set up. You can then run `npm install` to get the required packages. Once setup you just have to run `npm run dev` in order to set up the watcher. Npm will then take care of everything for you.

Since I am currently working on the CSS, npm only compiles the scss files. In the future it will generste rtl.css, combine javascript files, extra pot files, and probably more.
